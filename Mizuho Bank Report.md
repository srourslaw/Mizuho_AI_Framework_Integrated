5.0 Strategic AI Use Cases for Mizuho
Our analysis has identified two use cases that offer the ideal combination of high business value, alignment with Mizuho's strategic priorities, and technical feasibility.
Use Case 1: Sanctions Screening Precision AI AI-Powered False Positive Triage for Sanctions Screening
•	The Problem: Traditional rule-based screening systems in banking generate extremely high false positive rates (95-99%), creating significant operational overhead for compliance teams and delaying legitimate transactions.Leading financial institutions have invested heavily in powerful screening engines (e.g., Informatica IIR, FICO Sirona). While essential, these systems are tuned for caution and can generate a high volume of alerts, with false positive rates often exceeding 98%. This creates a significant operational burden on L1/L2 compliance analysts who must manually investigate thousands of low-risk alerts.
•	The AI Solution: Our proposed application is not a replacement for Mizuho's existing screening engine. Instead, it is an intelligent "triage layer" that sits on top of it. It uses machine learning and NLP to analyze the alerts generated by the core engine. It goes beyond simple fuzzy logic to understand complex context, including phonetic variations (Smith/Smyth), cultural nicknames (Margaret/Peggy), and regional localizations. This allows the AI to automatically close a high percentage of low-risk false positives and intelligently prioritize the remaining alerts, enabling analysts to focus their expertise where it matters most.
•	Expected Outcomes:
o	A 70-85% reduction in the volume of false positive alerts requiring manual review.
o	A 40-60% improvement in overall processing efficiency for the sanctions alert workflow.
o	Enhanced Auditability and Transparency with explainable AI (XAI) features that provide a clear rationale for every triaged decision, satisfying regulators.
Use Case 2: IT Operations Reliability AI
•	The Problem: System reliability is a fundamental requirement for customer trust and regulatory compliance. The challenge is to move from a reactive "firefighting" model to a proactive, predictive posture.
•	The AI Solution: A bank-owned AI application that complements the IBM watsonx investment. It uses machine learning to analyze infrastructure telemetry, identify subtle anomalies that precede incidents, and provide automated root cause analysis and remediation guidance.
•	Expected Outcomes:
o	A 40-60% improvement in the Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) for system anomalies.
o	A 30-50% reduction in incident resolution time (MTTR).
o	Proactive prevention of 20-30% of potential customer-impacting incidents.
