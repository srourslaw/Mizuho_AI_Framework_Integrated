This message: "I have tied to combine our consulting part and 8-Step framework and OrbusInfinity to something practical. After speaking with Orbus we agreed it would be best (if they can invest) for them to shadow the process and from the info find the best way to present their tool. Then we would overlay our 8-steps as a combined need. We will still be able to do it all without the tool of course, but hopefully we can start to show that the process will be faster to make decisions with their tool" is from Jeremy and the document he shared is below:

Mizuho Bank AI Initiative – 2 week Workshops
Where and how to start the journey whilst keeping a close eye on the strategic objectives.
1.0 Project Charter
1.1 Introduction and Strategic Intent
This document serves as a guide for the Mizuho Bank AI Initiative, a joint discovery between Thakral One and Mizuho Bank. The primary objective is to define a clear roadmap to implement the strategic objectives with regular definitive deliveries along the way. This immersive experience will replace traditional static approaches of ‘build it and they will come’ with a progressive approach, serving as both a powerful consulting methodology and a compelling, evidence-based business case for AI adoption.
1.2 Partnership Roles
The success of this initiative is predicated on a synergistic partnership:
Mizhuo Bank: Will provide access to staff, review and validate initiatives, gain appropriate approvals as well as all required data, tools and environments.

Thakral One: Will lead the strategic direction referencing their 8-step process, providing expert consulting, business case development and banking experience.

Orbus Software – Thakral One recommends including Orbus Software during the 2 weeks as their Enterprise Architecture tooling OrbusInfinity can greatly improve the longer term decision making. This is achieved by intelligently heatmapping business process which would benefit from projects based on cost, efficiency, capabilities and the organisation’s strategic ambitions.
1.3 Core Workshop Objectives
This initiative is designed to achieve specific strategic objectives:
Demonstrate that our credible and compelling consulting framework will directly addresses Mizuho Bank's uncertainty around AI implementation.
Assess what AI means for different teams in the IT Department; at a high-lvel assess their AI Literacy; assess the relative processes, data and IT assets needed to realise some specific identified use cases and identifying gaps blocking a successful outcom.
In parallel, the appropriate guardrails and required policies will be attentioned to ensure that the ambition is not greater than the capability to deliver. This may be in the areas of skills, risk, what is permissible and effort.
2.0 How the approach is driven
Organisations need to learn and deliver AI in parallel. Data  is the lifeblood of AI. The more centralised the better. This enables faster and better insights. However, when the data is in many disperate systems in different countries it be a very long wait before all this data is centralied and AI projects (beyond embedded AI in vendor systems) can start. Therefore, Thakral One takes a more pragmatick approach to ensure the momentum continues where the risk remains the same or reduces as the organisation matures and the deliveries become more complex and / or use more sensitive data. By doint this the organisation can gain confidence in evaluating their own AI ambitions and those embedded in the vendor systems the bank has in place  (or when they are upgraded).
Typical obstacles and how they are overcome:
The bank has not yet define the AI policy and guardrails
This can be a major stumbling block to starting. The CISO won’t permit any activity until this has been defined.
We don’t know what we need AI for
This is usually an eduction problem. AI literacy is variyed and many people assess themselves to be significantly better than they are. As such they struggle to articulate how AI can help their role.

An example of how this can be overcome:
Start with conservative definitions of what data classification can use which compute services. In the event of a leak it is contained and the CISO will be on-board:
Public Data  can use public AI api services, bank’s cloud tenance services (AWS, Azure etc) or on-premise compute servers
Internal Unclassified data can use the bank’s cloud tenancy services (AWS,Azure etc)
Internal classified data can only be processed on on-premise compute services.
Have the first project use publicly available or internal unclassifed data.
Select a simple use cases which have limited risk of failure but have a wide audience benefit. This gains tracktion and excitement without the risk. Each AI type should be explored to determine what such a use case would look like.
GenAI LLM example: Chatbot on HR policies (pdf documents) which will illeviate basic questions to HR and get faster answers for the staff. “What’s the policy on business travel and how do I book all the flights and hotels?”. “What is the paternity leave policy?” etc.
Assess how access control can be applied so the responses take this into consideration and do not provide responses which are not permitted to that user.
Continuing the example : Repeat the above, but now include country specific policies and validate that they are observed.
Have expcetions based on regional roles – like HR personnel can receive information about any location and can start to compare across the region where staff cannot.
Learn, understand, and repeat with more complex use cases using more sensitive data.

then email from Santie:
Thank you Jeremy,

Hussein can you please incorporate this into your document for us.

Kind Regards

Santie

Then Santie sent me two emails with two attachements:

Good morning Hussein,

Thank you for this but we please need to ensure that we underpin everything on our framework.

I am sharing our Framework and the RFP response we did for Manila Water for you to have all the data.

Kind Regards

Santie

It is also very important that we understand their current investments and public position.

Regards

Santie

so she wants to use the attachement in the final blueprint taking in account everything Jeremy said and what she said as well

What Mizuho is doing now (relevant signals)
•	Formal AI org: Mizuho created the AIX Promotion Office in April 2024 to own group-wide AI strategy and scale internal usage of generative AI (e.g., Wiz Chat). This shows top-down sponsorship and appetite for practical, ops-focused AI. mizuhogroup.com
•	Ops/reliability AI: With IBM watsonx, Mizuho ran a PoC to improve event detection & recovery time in operations—very aligned to using AI for production resilience and incident response. IBM Newsroom
•	DX/Cloud alliances: Ongoing Google Cloud collaboration for digital transformation (retail innovation & DX foundations) suggests comfort with strategic hyperscaler partnerships. mizuhogroup.com
•	Public DX stance: Corporate pages emphasize DX, data talent, and AI as strategic pillars—useful for mirroring language in our proposal. mizuhogroup.com
•	Capital markets momentum: CEO Masahiro Kihara is pushing to be a top-10 global IB, integrating Greenhill and expanding advisory—useful context for pitching AI-augmented regulatory reporting and deal/advisory knowledge AI as “speed-to-insight” plays. Financial Times+2FNLondon+2
Issues & risk themes we can target (externally visible)
•	Historic system-stability scrutiny: Japan’s FSA issued administrative actions in 2021 after multiple outages. While dated, reliability remains a reputational sensitivity—our “AI for event detection / auto-remediation” storyline maps perfectly. Financial Services Agency+1
•	Cyber posture: Reports pointed to DDoS-style disruptions (Dec 2024). We should frame any security/ops AI as defense-in-depth and resilience enhancements. The Japan Times+1
•	Third-party risk: 2025 vendor breach reports (e.g., Chain IQ incident implicating major banks as customers) reinforce a supplier-risk narrative. Treat as context for quiet vendor review—not a smoking gun about Mizuho itself. INCIBE
•	Sanctions & AML posture: Mizuho publicly affirms compliance with OFAC/UN/Japan FEFTA and maintains AML policies; we should position sanctions screening AI as precision & auditability upgrades rather than “gap filling.” Business & Human Rights Resource Centre+1
Where to focus the Discovery POC (tie directly to CIO’s 5 points)

AI Discovery – 1–2 use cases (low-risk, high-signal)
o	Primary: Sanctions Screening Precision AI
	Goals: cut false positives, improve explainability & audit trail, and accelerate case triage.
	Why it lands: aligns with public compliance posture (we’re enhancing precision & governance, not replacing policies). Business & Human Rights Resource Centre
o	Secondary: Ops Reliability AI (event detection + recovery guidance)
	Goals: anomaly detection on infra/app telemetry, mean-time-to-detect/recover improvements, playbooks.
	Why it lands: mirrors the IBM watsonx direction but offers an independent angle and bank-owned IP path. IBM Newsroom
Data Lake
o	Pitch a governed Lakehouse pilot that feeds both use cases (sanctions logs + ops telemetry), mapping to Mizuho’s DX narrative and cloud alliances. We’ll emphasize lineage (Purview), RBAC/ABAC, and privacy-by-design, reusing the 8-step framework’s foundations. mizuhogroup.com+1
Regulatory Reporting
o	Show reporting helper that classifies & assembles inputs from the Lake for selected returns (mocked/synthetic). Position as control strengthening (traceability, data quality), not just efficiency.
Advisory & Quiet Review of Vendors/Staff
o	Angle 1: Third-party risk & resilience (given industry vendor incidents).
o	Angle 2: Skills map vs. AIX Promotion Office—where to double down internally vs. buy/partner. mizuhogroup.com+1
Sanctions List (AI use case) – governance-first
o	Add model cards, bias testing, HITL, and explanations suitable for regulators/auditors, reinforcing trust.
Talking points to use with the CIO (positioning)
•	“We’ll complement ongoing ops-AI work (e.g., IBM PoC) by building a bank-owned, explainable layer that you can scale, not a black box.” IBM Newsroom
•	“Our governed Lakehouse serves both sanctions and reg-reporting—one foundation, multiple regulated outcomes.” mizuhogroup.com
•	“Given the historic focus on resilience and current DDoS threat landscape, our reliability AI closes the loop from detection→playbooks→recovery.” Financial Services Agency+1
•	“Sanctions AI isn’t about relaxing controls—it's about reducing noise with better transparency to strengthen compliance.” Business & Human Rights Resource Centre
Add to the deck (1 slide each)
•	Market context: “What Mizuho is already doing in AI” (AIX Office, IBM PoC, GCP DX). mizuhogroup.com+2IBM Newsroom+2
•	Risk backdrop: outages (historic), DDoS (2024), vendor risk (2025). Financial Services Agency+2The Japan Times+2
•	Our POC fit: 2 use cases + Lakehouse + Governance + Quiet Review mapped to the 8-step framework (use your MWCI framework slides as backbone).

What Mizuho is doing outside Japan (signals to mirror)
•	CIO, Asia-Pac (Andy Kiheung Nam): public profiles confirm his remit; useful to reference “bank-owned IP, explainable AI, and scale across Asia” in your pitch language. THE ORG+1
•	Singapore hub activity: frequent macro publications and client notes explicitly issued by Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Singapore Branch (MBSG) → anchor POC pilots and showcases in SG. Mizuho Financial Group+2Mizuho Financial Group+2
•	Regional expansion & re-mix: sale of global custody businesses outside Japan to State Street (Feb 2025) signals portfolio reshaping overseas—talk “focus on higher-ROE, advisory, and capital-light digital services in Asia.” State Street Investors
•	India push: visible momentum—Credit Saison India funding and reported Avendus deal chatter; CEO reiterates India as a strategic priority. Frame India as the first scale market for AI controls + reporting templates. The Economic Times+2The Economic Times+2
•	APAC partnerships: BNY trade-services collaboration (Beijing); APAC sustainability initiatives (SAF). These validate cross-border ops/use cases for AI controls and data harmonisation. BNY+1
Regulatory & risk backdrop to lean into (Asia, non-JP)
•	Singapore enforcement climate: MAS’s 2023–24 report and July 2025 AML actions against nine FIs raise the bar on KYC/AML, sanctions precision, third-party risk—great context for your Sanctions AI and vendor/staff quiet review. (No public MAS action naming Mizuho in that round—use market pressure, not accusation.) Monetary Authority of Singapore+2Reuters+2
•	Ops resilience narrative: keep linking to resilience and incident-response automation as board-level priorities in SG/HK—fits your Ops Reliability AI optional use case. Sidley Austin
Talk-track for Andy (positioning bullets)
•	“We’ll pilot in Singapore, where your teams already issue research and client notes, and then template for HK/India—same governance spine, different regulator overlays (MAS, HKMA, RBI).” Mizuho Financial Group
•	“On India, we’ll align with the growth agenda—start with sanctions precision & explainability and a reporting helper that accelerates RBI/MAS/HKMA-consistent packs from one Lakehouse.” The Economic Times
•	“Given the enforcement climate in Singapore, our governance-first Sanctions AI reduces false positives and improves auditability (model cards, lineage, HITL).” Reuters+1
•	“We’ll complement regional partnerships (BNY, sustainability/SAF) with bank-owned, explainable AI—no black boxes, portable across Asia.” BNY+1
POC tweaks (Asia-ex-JP fit)

Primary AI use case: Sanctions Precision (SG pilot → HK → IN)
o	Train/test on synthetic + de-identified logs; show explainability, model cards, lineage.
o	Outcome: ↓ false positives, faster L1 triage; Country pack with MAS/HKMA/RBI mappings. Reuters
Secondary use case (option): Ops Reliability AI
o	Anomaly detection across infra/app telemetry; playbooks for MTTD/MTTR reduction; demo in SG where tech teams sit. Sidley Austin
Data Lake stance (Asia template):
o	Singapore Lakehouse pilot with policy overlays for cross-border data (data residency + access tiers).
o	Reuse guardrails when rolling to Hong Kong and India. Mizuho Financial Group
Quiet advisory:
o	Benchmark vendor contracts, delivery quality, and skill depth against MAS expectations & regional peers; fold in lessons from recent market actions (without naming competitors in slides). Reuters
“Leave-behind” ideas Andy will like
•	Asia Controls Map: one-pager showing which control (sanctions, KYC, model risk) is satisfied where (MAS/HKMA/RBI), with links to data assets in the Lake. Monetary Authority of Singapore
•	Roll-out ladder: SG pilot → HK hardening → IN scale (ties to India growth story). The Economic Times
•	Third-party risk pulse: discreet review aligned to MAS priorities; hygiene actions and ownership matrix. Sidley Austin
