# Mizuho Asia AI Discovery Proposal – Enhanced Version with MLOps & Testing

## 1.0 Executive Summary

Mizuho has a unique opportunity to extend the Group AI strategy into Southeast Asia through a carefully governed, low-risk Discovery Proof of Concept (POC). This proposal outlines a practical, two-week engagement that validates the potential of AI for compliance and operational resilience, while ensuring governance, explainability, MLOps discipline, and regulatory readiness are embedded from the start.

Our approach is advisory-led, vendor-neutral, and built around Thakral One's proven 8-Step AI Adoption Framework. The Discovery POC provides two strategic sandbox options – **AI-Assisted Name Screening** and **IT Operations Reliability AI (Ticketing Insight)** – designed to demonstrate measurable outcomes using synthetic data only. Beyond the POC, the framework offers a clear journey for governance, testing, scaling, and regional adoption, ensuring sustainable AI impact across Asia.

## 2.0 Strategic Priorities and Alignment

Across our work with leading banks in Asia, we see five priorities consistently shaping responsible AI adoption. These priorities are directly relevant to Mizuho and inform the design of this Discovery POC proposal:

### 1. AI Discovery and Proof Points
Banks are under pressure to move from strategy to execution. Early, well-governed pilots are critical to demonstrate value and establish replicable models.

### 2. Data Lake Integration and Readiness
Group-level investments in data platforms succeed when regional pilots are designed with interoperability and governance in mind. AI use cases should feed into a sustainable enterprise data foundation.

### 3. Regulatory Reporting and Transparency
Regulators across Southeast Asia demand explainability and auditability from AI models. Every initiative must improve transparency and reporting, not just operational outcomes.

### 4. Capability and Delivery Assurance
Successful AI adoption depends on people, processes, and vendor ecosystems. Structured capability reviews provide assurance and highlight areas where reinforcement is needed. Where organisations lack visibility, platforms such as OrbusInfinity can optionally add value by mapping AI use cases against business processes, systems, and regulatory obligations. If equivalent tooling exists, we work with it; if not, Orbus provides an optional accelerator.

### 5. Sanctions and Compliance Efficiency
Compliance screening remains one of the most resource-intensive processes for banks. Reducing false positives and improving precision in sanctions and name screening provides one of the clearest opportunities for AI to deliver measurable efficiency gains while maintaining regulatory trust.

## 3.0 POC Option A: AI-Assisted Name Screening (Sanctions Precision)

**Objective:** Reduce the high false positive burden in sanctions and PEP screening while improving auditability and transparency.

### Problem Context
• Current systems generate over 95% false positives.
• Nicknames, phonetic variations, and localisation challenges increase complexity.
• Daily watchlist delta updates strain compliance teams.
• Legacy fuzzy logic engines (e.g., SSA-NAME3, IIR) tend to over-match.

### Solution Approach
• AI-driven fuzzy matching, alias mapping, and phonetic detection.
• Alias library expansion across cultures and languages.
• Delta refresh automation, continuously checking against KIV (Keep in View).
• Explainable scoring of every match, including alias/phonetic reason codes.

### Sandbox Demonstration
• Simulate onboarding with name check against synthetic watchlist.
• Simulate delta update processing with alerts on existing KIVs.

### Expected Outcomes (Benchmark Ranges)
• **70–85% reduction** in false positives.
• **40–60% reduction** in analyst review time.
• **90% faster** reprocessing of daily deltas.

### Governance Considerations
• Transparent scoring, match logs, and escalation triggers.
• Clear KIV handling for unresolved names.
• Full audit trail for regulatory comfort.

## 4.0 POC Option B: IT Operations Reliability AI (Ticketing Insight)

**Objective:** Improve infrastructure and application resilience by detecting anomalies, clustering incidents, and accelerating resolution.

### Problem Context
• High Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR).
• Large volumes of repetitive or duplicate tickets.
• Manual triage leads to inefficiencies and delays.

### Solution Approach
• AI-driven clustering of incidents to identify common root causes.
• Anomaly detection on ticket volumes and patterns.
• Automated "next best action" suggestions based on resolution history.

### Sandbox Demonstration
• Synthetic ITSM tickets and simulated system logs.
• Output: AI dashboard showing anomaly clusters, predicted outages, remediation guidance.

### Expected Outcomes (Benchmark Ranges)
• **40–60% reduction** in MTTD.
• **30–50% reduction** in MTTR.
• **25–35% reduction** in recurring incidents.

### Governance Considerations
• Transparent cluster explanations and recommendations.
• Escalation logic visible to IT Ops leadership.
• Lifecycle: triage → validation → remediation → closure.

## 5.0 Governance, MLOps, and Testing Principles

Governance is central to this engagement. Even at the discovery stage, you will see how governance-first AI reduces risk and builds regulatory trust.

### Core Principles

**Explainability** – Every decision is transparent and traceable.

**Traceability** – Each model output linked to inputs, logic, and reviewer.

**Lifecycle Oversight (MLOps)** – Model versioning, retraining workflows, drift detection, and bias monitoring are planned from POC onwards.

**Testing & Validation** – Unit tests for algorithms, SME validation for interpretability, and stress testing under regulatory scenarios.

**Compliance Overlays** – MAS, HKMA, RBI, AU, Philippines.

**Audit Logs** – Regulator-ready documentation from Day One.

This ensures that even discovery pilots are delivered with enterprise discipline, not as isolated experiments.

## 6.0 Journey Across the 8-Step Framework

The Discovery POC represents **Steps 1–4 of Thakral One's 8-Step AI Adoption Framework**, ensuring that pilots are embedded in a disciplined, regulator-ready methodology:

• **Step 1: Discover** – Define problems and candidate use cases.
• **Step 2: Assess** – Review data readiness, SME access, and governance implications.
• **Step 3: Prioritise** – Select the most valuable and feasible use case.
• **Step 4: Pilot** – Deliver sandbox prototypes with governance, explainability, MLOps discipline, and testing frameworks.

The journey then continues:

• **Step 5: Govern** – Define standards, controls, and oversight.
• **Step 6: Operationalise** – Integrate successful models into BAU with DevSecOps pipelines.
• **Step 7: Scale** – Replicate across geographies and business units.
• **Step 8: Optimise** – Monitor KPIs, retrain, and adapt to regulatory changes.

This means the POC is already the foundation of a long-term adoption journey, not an isolated test.

## 7.0 Illustrative Roadmap & Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Week 1–2): Discovery POC
Sandbox demo of selected use case with initial MLOps scaffolding.

### Phase 2 (Week 3–6): Pilot Refinement
SME validation, regulatory stress testing, and governance draft.

### Phase 3 (Week 7–10): Regional Adaptation Planning
Compliance overlays, integration into ITSM processes.

### Phase 4 (Beyond): Enterprise Scaling
Reuse patterns, retraining pipelines, and CoE enablement.

### Regional Implementation Strategy
The strategy begins with a pilot in Singapore, leveraging its advanced digital infrastructure. Success in this controlled environment will build confidence and create a template for expansion into Hong Kong and, subsequently, for the large-scale deployment required to support Mizuho's strategic growth in India.

## 10.0 Important Disclaimers & Caveats

**Sandbox Environment:** Demonstrations will use synthetic/sandboxed data only. No live sanctions lists or production ITSM data.

**Benchmark Ranges:** KPI ranges are based on peer bank case studies and are indicative only, not delivery commitments.

**Timeline Dependencies:** Timelines are illustrative and depend on SME access, data readiness, and stakeholder availability.

**Scope Limitations:** Not a full AML/KYC replacement. No live ServiceNow or equivalent integrations during POC phase.

**Optional Tooling:** Optional tools (e.g., OrbusInfinity) may enhance traceability but are not required for successful outcomes.

## 11.0 Conclusion

Together, these elements make Thakral One a differentiated partner: not just delivering a proof of concept, but enabling a disciplined, regionally adapted, regulator-ready, and production-scalable AI adoption journey.
